# Cities Skylines: Disasters Enabler Mod

This mod enables random disasters for scenarios.

What?! Does it mean that random disasters are disabled when you are playing a scenario?
Yes. And I don’t think that it is a good idea. That’s why I created this mod.

Some not well known facts about the game:

1. In the vanilla game the random disasters do not occur when you are playing a scenario. I’ve spend many hours of testing and studying the source code to confirm that this is true.
2. Disasters that occur when you are playing a scenario are only the scripted ones, i.e. defined by the scenario creator.
3. If you create a scenario but don’t add any disaster - no disaster will happen in the scenario. Ever.

Remark. There are intensity 1.0 thunderstorms happen time to time in any map or scenario. This is normal. Small thunderstorms are not treated as disasters.

Please remember that you are still have to enable random disasters in the game options.

Happy mayoring!
